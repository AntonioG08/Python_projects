# Python projects

In this repository I have excersies from a basic-intermediate 
Python course. Currently, I am still working with this repository in 
some personal projects that started with this course. Please feel free
to check the folders, the first folder has scripts and basics excersises
to start with Python. Some intermediate-advance themes in these
folders are related to:

- Pygame library for game developing
- Tkinter library for interface developing
- Face recognition and CV2 library for image and face recognition
projects
- Django library for web developing
